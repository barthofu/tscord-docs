# Environment variables

We are using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for loading `.env` into process environment variables and [envalid](https://github.com/af/envalid) to validate and access environment variables.

The variables are defined in the `src/utils/types/environment.ts` file. 

This file also contains a function executed upon startup to dynamically validate the environment variables. Indeed, many of them are required only if the associated service is enabled (e.g: the API or the automatic image upload).

## Usage

To access an environment variable, you can use the `env` object from `@/env`:

```ts
import { env } from '@/env'

console.log(env.BOT_OWNER_ID)
```
