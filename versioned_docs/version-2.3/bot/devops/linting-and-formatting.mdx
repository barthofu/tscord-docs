# Linting and Formatting

Linting and formatting are important parts of the development process. They help to ensure that your code is consistent and free of errors.

We use `eslint` for both linting and formatting. `eslint` is a popular tool for linting and formatting JavaScript code. It is highly configurable and can be used to enforce a wide range of coding standards.

Our opiniated configuration is a tweaked version of [antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config), but you can modify it anytime in the `eslint.config.js` file.

## Usage

### CLI

You can run the linting from the command line using the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you want to also format your code by fixing the styling whenever it is possible, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Editor

We ship with a `.vscode` folder that contains a `settings.json` file. This file will automatically recommand you the `eslint` extension and format your code on save.
