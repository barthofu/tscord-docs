# Publish

We're using a public Github repository as the central registry for plugins.

In order to add your plugin to the registry, you need to:
1. Fork the [tscord-plugins](https://github.com/barthofu/tscord-plugins) repository.
2. Create a new branch named `feat/plugin-name` where `plugin-name` is the name of your plugin.
4. Go back to the tscord project where you develop your plugin.
5. Run the `npm run lint:fix` command
6. Copy/paste your plugin folder in the `plugins` folder of the `barthofu/plugin-tscord` repo
7. Commit and push to your forked repository
8. Open a PR following the given template between `barthofu/plugin-tscord`'s `main` branch and yours
9. Wait till it's aproved by the Core Team and then it'll automatically be merged and made available to the public through the CLI
