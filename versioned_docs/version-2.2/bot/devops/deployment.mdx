# Deployment

On this page, we'll list some options on how to host your bot, including free options!

## Self hosting

Either at home or in a data center, these solutions are full managed by **you**! 

## Home computer

Nothing really particular here, you can use an old computer or a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) in order to host your bot. With this solution however, you'll be in charge of the uptime and production of your bot.

### Discord bot specific hosts

- [Sparked](https://sparkedhost.com/discord-bot-hosting) (from 1$/month)
- [Something Host](https://something.host/en/products/discord-bot-hosting/?utm_source=geekflare&utm_medium=bot_hosting_platforms) (from 1.5$/month)

### VPS

You can use a VPS (Virtual Private Server) to host your bot.

It is basically a no-GUI remote linux computer on which you connect through [SSH](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell).

Here is a sample list of some VPS providers:
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) (from 3.5$/month)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets) (from 4$/month)

### [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) <Badge>free</Badge>

## Cloud hosting

### [Railway](https://railway.app/) <Badge>free</Badge>

Railway billing is quite particular. In fact, you pay for the resources usage you make.

Then, if your bill of the month is under **5$**, it is free.<br/>

But if you haven't set a credit card, you'll be limited to 500h of usage per month (~21d). To disable this limit, just register a credit card but take care: if your usage exceed 5$/month, it'll be paid automatically using your card.

Don't worry however, the estimation for a classic discord bot is **3$/month**.
