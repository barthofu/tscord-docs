# TSCord Plugins

> #### TSCord template is fully extensible thanks to the plugin eco-system!

Each plugin is a sub-component of the original TSCord discord bot template, so they can provide:
- handlers (commands, events, etc)
- services
- guards
- utils
- api endpoints
- *etc...*

They're stored in the [barthofu/tscord-plugins](https://github.com/barthofu/tscord-plugins) repository and they're all verified by a TSCord core team member.
