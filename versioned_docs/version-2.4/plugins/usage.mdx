# Usage


### Manage plugins

In order to install, uninstall, search, update, etc plugins, you'll need the official TSCord CLI:
```bash
npm install -g tscord-cli 
```

To know all the plugin-related commands of the CLI, **[go to this part of the doc](/docs/cli/usage#plugin)**.

### Imports

To use a plugin from the template or from another plugin, simply use the global module path followed by a slash and the name of the plugin folder. For example, to import the "Twilio" service class from the "twilio" plugin, simply do the following: 

You can use any plugin components wherever you want just by using scoped imports composed of the global module path followed by a slash and the name of the plugin folder.

For example, to import the `MyPluginService` from the `my-plugin` plugin, you can do the following:

```ts
import { MyPluginService } from '@/services/my-plugin'
``` 

### Translations

There's a high probability that a plugin you want to use do not support all the same languages than your bot, so you can't add and edit translation for each locales.

To do that:
1. First run the bot in `dev` mode after installed the plugin so the translation will be generated inside `/src/i18n/`.
2. Copy the file `/src/i18n/{locale}/{plugin name}/index.ts` as `/src/i18n/{locale}/{plugin name}/_custom.ts` and put your Translations inside. <br/>
3. Run again the bot in `dev` mode and your custom translation should be loaded!
