# CI/CD

TSCord bundles a complete setup for **[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**!

Github Actions lets you automate your workflow for building, testing and deploying your application.

More concretely, the provided config will permit you to deploy your bot to a SSH accessible remote machine (like a VPS) on precise events, like the creation of a tag on Github, a push to the `main` branch, on demand, etc...

## Configuration

### Secrets

First, you need to setup some _secrets_ in the settings of your github repo (**Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions**).

From there, add the following secrets (don't worry, after you've set a secret nobody will be able to read it):

| Name           | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `IP`           | The IP of the machine that will host your bot         |
| `PORT`         | Put `22` (SSH port)                                   |
| `USER`         | Name of the host user to connect as                   |
| `PASSWORD`     | Password of the host user to connect as               |
| `PROJECT_PATH` | The absolute path to your project on the host machine |

If you want to use SSH private key with passphrase instead of a regular password, you'll need to add 2 more secrets:

| Name         | Description                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `KEY`        | Raw content of SSH private key |
| `PASSPHRASE` | SSH key passphrase             |

And then edit the following file like that:

```yaml title=.github/workflows/deploy.yml
        with:
            host: ${{ secrets.IP }}
            username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
            // remove-next-line
            password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
            // remove-next-line
            # key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
            // remove-next-line
            # passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}
            // add-next-line
            # password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
            // add-next-line
            key: ${{ secrets.KEY }}
            // add-next-line
            passphrase: ${{ secrets.PASSPHRASE }}
            port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
```

:::danger
Passphrase support of `ssh-deploy` action is quite janky for the moment. You shouldn't use it.
:::

### Permissions

For the deploy script to be able to pull your repositories inside your actions, you must set the `Settings` > `Actions` > `General` > `Actions permissions` to this: **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**

### Private repository

If your repository is private, you'll need to do a few more extra steps.

You can either use a **Personal Access Token** or an **SSH key**.

#### Personal Access Token

1. Create a new token on Github: **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Generate new token**
2. Give it the `repo` scope
3. Copy the final token
4. Create 2 new secrets in your repository: **Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions** > **New repository secret**
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` with the token as value
   - `GITHUB_USERNAME` with your Github username as value
5. Edit the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file like that:
   ```yaml
   script: |
     cd $PROJECT_PATH
     // remove-next-line
     git pull https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>.git main
     // add-next-line
     git pull https://${ secrets.GITHUB_USERNAME }:${ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }@github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>.git main
     //...
   ```

#### SSH key

1. Generate a new SSH key on your final host: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"`
   :::caution
   Don't use ed25519 keys, as they are not supported by the `ssh-deploy` action.
   :::
2. Add the public key to your Github account: [GitHub > Your Profile > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys](https://github.com/settings/keys). This will allow the action to pull your repository from your host.
3. Add the private key to your repository secrets: `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` > `Secrets`. Name it `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and paste the content of the private key.
4. Fill the `known_hosts` file with the host key fingerprints of Github. You can find them [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints).
5. Add the key to your host's SSH agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```
6. Clone your repository: `git clone git@github.com:<your_github_user>/<your_github_project>.git`
7. Edit the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file like that:
   ```yaml
   script: |
   script: |
     cd $PROJECT_PATH
     // remove-next-line
     git pull https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>.git main
     // add-next-line
     git pull git@github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>.git main
   ```

### Workflow config file

Then, you can customize the behavior in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` config file.

:::tip
To know how to use Github Actions config files, **[check the doc here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)**.
:::

By default, the deploy workflow is only triggerable on-demand (**Actions** > **Deploy (SSH)** > **Run workflow**).<br />
We recommand you to either add a trigger on release tag creation or on pushes on your `main` branch, depending on your global git workflow.

Also, by default, the deploy action will use **Docker**, but you can easily replace it with **PM2**:

```yml title=.github/workflows/deploy.yml
script: |
  cd $PROJECT_PATH
  git pull https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>.git main
  // remove-next-line
  docker-compose up -d --build
  // add-next-line
  pm2 restart pm2.config.json
```

:::info
Each line under the `script` property is a command that'll be run on your host machine. You can customize it as you want!
