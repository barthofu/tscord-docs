# Usage


### Manage plugins

In order to install, uninstall, search, update, etc plugins, you'll need the official TSCord CLI:
```bash
npm install -g tscord-cli 
```

To know all the plugin-related commands of the CLI, **[go to this part of the doc](/docs/cli/usage#plugin)**.

### Imports

You can use any plugin components wherever you want just by using imports like this:
```ts
import { ThePluginService } from '@services/{pluginName}'
``` 
where `{pluginName}` is the name of the plugin folder.

### Translations

There's a high probability that a plugin you want to use do not support all the same languages than your bot, so you can't add and edit translation for each locales. <br/>
To do that:
1. First run the bot in `dev` mode after installed the plugin so the translation will be generated inside `/src/i18n/`.
2. Copy the file `/src/i18n/{locale}/{plugin name}/index.ts` as `/src/i18n/{locale}/{plugin name}/_custom.ts` and put your Translations inside. <br/>
3. Run again the bot in `dev` mode and your custom translation should be loaded!
