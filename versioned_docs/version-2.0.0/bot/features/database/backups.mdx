# Backups

:::warning
#### Backups are only supported by __SQLite__ databases!

If you're using other databases, script your own backup system.
:::

TSCord use **[saveqlite](https://github.com/barthofu/saveqlite)** to make incrementals backups of the SQLite database file.

Backing up a SQLite database file on a regular basis can quickly become really heavy. Indeed, the total weight of the backup will be `(database_size * num_backups)`.

With an incremental backup system, only the difference since the last snapshot is saved!

So we end up with a lightweight save, including multiple snapshots to rollback to any state of the database.

## Scheduled backups

A backup is [scheduled](/docs/bot/features/scheduler) per day, happening at **23:59:59** (or *11:59:59 pm*).
You can modify this time or the frequency in the `src/services/Database.ts` file at the `backup()` method.

## Manual backups

You can either create a backup programmaticaly by calling this `backup()` method and by referencing a custom file name for the backup.

E.g:
```ts
// first, we import the Database service
const db = container.resolve(Database)

// then we chose a name for the backup snapshot
const snapshotName = `snapshot-${formatDate(new Date(), 'onlyDateFileName')}-manual-${Date.now()}`

// finaly, we generate the snapshot
const success = await db.backup(snapshotName)
```

## API backups

Finaly, you can create a backup using the [API](/docs/bot/features/api) by simply make a *POST* request on this endpoint:
```
http://localhost:3000/database/backup
```

The server will return a response containing the name of the backup.

## Restore a backup

To restore a precise backup, you will have to either:
- Use the `restore()` method of the *Database* service.
- Make a POST request on the `http://localhost:3000/database/restore` endpoint and precising the `snapshotName` in the body.
