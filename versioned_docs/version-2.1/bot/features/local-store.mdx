# Local Store

TSCord uses [rxeta](https://github.com/barthofu/rxeta) to store reactive data at runtime.
This library was written especially for this project.

It uses [rxjs](https://rxjs.dev/) and a dead simple `get`/`set`/`update` interface to manipulate data in a reactive and efficient way.

## Initialization
First, you need to define the **shape** (interface/type) of the data you'll store in the `Store` service:

```ts title=src/services/Store.ts
interface State {
    count: number
}
```

Then, define the **initial state** of your data when the bot starts:
    
```ts title=src/services/Store.ts
interface State {
    count: number
}

//highlight-start
const initialState: State = {
    count: 0
}
//highlight-end
```

## Usage
Now, you can use the `Store` service to get/set/update your data:

```ts title=src/services/Store.ts
import { container } from 'tsyringe'
import { Store } from '@services'

const store = container.resolve(Store)

//set
this.store.set('count', 1)

//update
this.store.update('count', (count) => count + 1)

//get
const count = this.store.get('count')
console.log(count) // -> 2
```

### Subscriptions

The whole point of this store is that it is *reactive*. So you can subscribe to changes in the data (weither the full store or a particular state) and react to them.

```ts title=src/services/Store.ts
import { container } from 'tsyringe'
import { Store } from '@services'

const store = container.resolve(Store)

store.subscribe((state) => {
    console.log('The whole state has changed!')
    console.log('New state:', state)
})

store.select('count').subscribe((count) => {
    console.log('New count:', count)
})
```
