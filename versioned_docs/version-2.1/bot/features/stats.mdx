# Stats

TSCord comes with a fully-featured statistic service!
It will track and collect stats on many things automatically.

## Daily stats

A scheduled job will run each day at 11:59pm in order to register the stats of the day. 

These stats includes total amounts for:
- **Commands**
- **Guilds**
- **Users**
- **Active users** (users that have interacted at least once with the bot)

## Interactions

Each interaction is also registered with some optional additional information.

### Configuration

To configure which interactions should **not** be registered, you can edit the `src/config/stats.ts` config file:

```ts title=src/config/stats.ts
export const statsConfig: StatsConfigType = {

    interaction: {

        exclude: [
            'BUTTON_INTERACTION',
            'SELECT_MENU_INTERACTION'
        ]
    }
}
```

The different types are:

- `CHAT_INPUT_COMMAND_INTERACTION` 
- `SIMPLE_COMMAND_MESSAGE` 
- `CONTEXT_MENU_INTERACTION`
- `BUTTON_INTERACTION`
- `SELECT_MENU_INTERACTION` 
- `MODAL_SUBMIT_INTERACTION`

### Registration

When an interaction is registered, here are the info that are saved in the database:
- `type` -> the type of the interaction (correspond to the types written above)
- `action` -> which "command" has been submitted (e.g: `help` if a user invoke the `/help` slash command)
- `additional_data` -> additional info including the `user`, `channel` and `guild` ids related to the invocation of the command

## Events

Some events are also registered such as:

| Type            | Action     | Description                                                               |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NEW_USER`      | *user id*  | A new user has interacted with the bot for the first time                 |
| `NEW_GUILD`     | *guild id* | The bot has been added to a new guild                                     |
| `DELETE_GUILD`  | *guild id* | The bot has been removed from a guild                                     |
| `RECOVER_GUILD` | *guild id* | The bot has been re-added to a guild it has been removed from in the past |
