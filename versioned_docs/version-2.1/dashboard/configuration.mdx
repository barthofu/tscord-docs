# Configuration

Before anything else, head over to your **bot** config and enable the API server and Websocket client.

## Client

1. Copy the `client/.env.example`
2. Fill in all the variables

:::info
You can find your bot's **secret** in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Click on your application and then go to the OAuth2 tab. You will find it under the `Client Secret` section.
:::
3. Go on your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
4. Click on your application
5. Go to the `OAuth2` tab
6. Add the following redirect URIs:
    - http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord
    - <your_domain>/api/auth/callback/discord (if you are running the app on a domain in production)
7. Copy the `Client Id` and the `Client Secret`
8. Paste them in the `.env.example` file, as well as your bot API admin token.
9. Rename the file `.env`
10. Go to the `client/src/core/config/bots.ts`
11. Fill in your bot info (here is a sample)
    ```ts
        {
            id: '943804890143133736',
            name: 'TSCord',
            iconUrl: 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/943804890143133736/c08ad02818b89d43210a232094b32215.webp',
            apiUrl: process.env['TSCORD_API_URL']!,
            apiToken: process.env['TSCORD_API_TOKEN']!,
            secret: process.env['TSCORD_SECRET']!
        }
    ```
    :::tip 
    As you may have noticed, the bots config is an array, so you can setup multiple bots!
    :::
12. Run `npm run build` in the `client` folder
13. Then, run `npm run start`

## Websocket

In order to make the **Monitoring** dashboard page working, you must spin up the Websocket proxy server on which your bot *and* your Next.js app will connect.

1. Edit the `proxy/.env.example` at your convenance
2. Rename it `.env`
3. Put the correct websocket url to access the proxy server both in the Next.js app and TSCord bot env files
4. Go to the `proxy` folder
5. Run `npm run build`
6. Run `npm run start`
7. Now, if your bot is running in parallel, you should see in the console: `New client connected: <name_of_your_bot>`
