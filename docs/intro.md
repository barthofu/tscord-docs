# Introduction

TSCord is a fully-featured template written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for **discord bots**, intended to provide a framework that's easy to use, extend and modify.

It uses [discord.ts](https://github.com/oceanroleplay/discord.ts) and [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) under the hood to simplify the development of discord bots.
