# ðŸŒŸ What is TSCord

<hr/>

**TSCord** is a fully-featured **Discord bots** *template* written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), intended to provide a framework that's easy to use, extend and modify.

It uses [`discordx`](https://github.com/oceanroleplay/discordx) and [`discord.js v13`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) under the hood to simplify the development of discord bots.

This template was created to give developers a starting point for new Discord bots, so that much of the initial setup can be avoided and developers can instead focus on meaningful bot features. Developers can simply copy this repo, follow the [setup instructions](https://barthofu.github.io/tscord-docs), and have a working bot with many boilerplate features already included!
