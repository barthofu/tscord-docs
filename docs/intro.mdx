# Introduction

**TSCord** is a fully-featured **[discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps)** *template* written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), intended to provide a framework that's easy to use, extend and modify.

It uses [`discordx`](https://github.com/discordx-ts/discordx) and [`discord.js v14`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) under the hood to simplify the development of discord bots.

This template was created to give developers a starting point for new Discord bots, so that much of the initial setup can be avoided and developers can instead focus on meaningful bot features. Developers can simply follow the [installation](https://tscord.discbot.app/docs/bot/get-started/installation) and [setup](https://tscord.discbot.app/docs/bot/get-started/configuration) instructions, and have a working bot with many boilerplate features already included!        

## Features

Talking about features, here are some of the core features of the template:

- Advanced **handlers** for:
    - Interactions (slash, context menu, button, modal, select menu, etc)
    - Simple message commands
    - Discord events listeners
- **Guards** functions, acting like middlewares on handlers with some built-ins:
    - Rate limiter
    - Maintenance mode
    - Disabling command
    - Guild only command (no DMs)
    - NSFW only command
    - Message's content match using regex
- Internal **API** to interact with the bot from external services, with built-in useful endpoints
- Multiple **databases** support out-of-the-box using [Mikro-ORM](https://mikro-orm.io/)
- **Migrations** system to keep a safe database
- **Custom events** handlers
- Advanced **error handler**
- Fully-typed **localization** (i18n)
- Local **store** to manage global state through the app
- Advanced **logger** with log files and discord channels support
- **Scheduler** for cron jobs
- Built-in rich **statistics** system
- Automatic **static assets upload** to [imgur](https://imgur.com/)

This template is also developer friendly and follow strict design patterns to ease its maintenance:
- Written in **Typescript**
- Built around the **Dependency Injection** and **Singleton** patterns
- Use of battle-tested **libraries** under the hood (*discordx* and *discord.js*)
- **Linting** and **formatting** thanks to a top-notch ESLint config
- Typesafe and validated **environment variables**
- Built-in **debugging** setup for VSCode
- Support for running with the **[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)** process manger
- Support for running with **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**
- CI/CD integration with **Github Actions**

*and many more!*
