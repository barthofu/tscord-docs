# Assets

We all know that working with assets (and mainly images) is really painful with Discord bots.<br/>
Indeed, embeds allow you to only use **hosted images**, which can be quite annoying to manage and to work with.

But TSCord solves this issue!<br/>
It has an auto image upload service that will *scan* every image file in the `assets/images` directory and upload them on [imgur](https://imgur.com/).<br/>
The uploaded images url are then saved in the `image` table of the database, along with some useful metadata.

## Enable image upload

Go to `src/config/general.ts` and set the `automaticUploadImageToImgur` property to `true`
```ts title=src/config/general.ts
export const generalConfig: GeneralConfigType = {
    //...
    //highlight-next-line
    automaticUploadImagesToImgur: true,
    //...
}
```

Then, you'll have to get a Client ID in order to use the Imgur API.<br/>
Steps to follow:

1. Sign in or register on imgur - https://imgur.com/
2. Navigate to the following page to register an OAuth application - https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient
3. Fill the form with your application details
4. On the authorization callback URL section, register the following URL: https://imgur.com/
5. Click on "Save" and that's it!

Now just paste the `Client ID` in your `.env` file on the following property:
```env title=.env
IMGUR_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_IMGUR_CLIENT_ID"
```

Now that the upload service is enabled, the next time you start the bot it'll upload all images recursively in the `assets/images` directory.

Plus, if an image is removed from the directory, it'll also be removed from both database and imgur, and if one has a broken link on imgur, it'll be automatically reuploaded!

## Image entity

When an image is uploaded, the following data is saved in the db:

| Property     | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **fileName** | string   | The file name of the image (including its format)                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **basePath** | string   | Relative path to the image, using the `assets/images` directory as root path                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **url**      | string   | The imgur hosted URL to access the image                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **size**     | number   | Total size of the image in Bytes                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **tags**     | string[] | Editable list of tags to batch search images of the same type. By default, it will split the `basePath` of the image in different tags (ex: if the image is located in `assets/images/foo/bar/image.png`, it'll have the `foo` and `bar` tags |

The `hash` and `deleteHash` properties are also stored in the database, but it is meant for an internal operation so don't worry about these.

## Use images

To use images in your code, just retrieve it from the database:
```ts
import { injectable } from 'tsyringe'

import { Database } from '@services'
import { Image } from '@entities'
import { Discord } from '@decorators'

@Discord()
@injectable()
export default class PingCommand {

    constructor(
        private db: Database
    )

    @Slash({ name: 'ping' })
    async pingHandler(
        interaction: CommandInteraction
    ) {

        //highlight-next-line
        const image = await this.db.get(Image).findOne({ fileName: 'image.png' }) // find by fileName

        // or you can find by tags
        //highlight-next-line
        const imagesExplicit = await this.db.get(Image).findByTags(['foo', 'bar']) // will search for images that have 'foo' AND 'bar'
        //highlight-next-line
        const imagesNonExplicit = await this.db.get(Image).findByTags(['foo', 'bar'], false) // will search for images that have 'foo' OR 'bar'

        interaction.followUp(image.url)
    }
}
```
