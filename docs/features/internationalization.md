# Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization is the process to provide automated translations based on locales (languages) extracted from any user input.

TSCord uses the excellent **[typesafe-i18n](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n)** package, that provides a fully typed tranlation system, with string templating and many more!
