# Custom Events

We've extended the behavior of `@On` and `@Once` decorators so they can work flawlessly with any kind of custom event.
In fact, you can emit and handle your own events!

In order to emit an event, use the `emit()` method on your `Client` instance:

```ts
import { singleton } from '@tsyringe'
import { Client } from 'discordx'

@singleton()
export class YourService {

    constructor(
        private client: Client
    ) {}

    doSomething() {

        // highlight-next-line
        this.client.emit('myCustomEvent')
    }
}
```

And then handle it with a method decorated with the `@On` or `@Once` decorators:

```ts
import { Discord, On } from '@decorators'

@Discord()
export class YourEventHandler {

    // highlight-next-line
    @On('myCustomEvent')
    handleMyCustomEvent() {

        console.log('I handled my custom event!')
    }
}
```

:::caution
Note that the class where you handle the event must be decorated with the `@Discord()` decorator.
