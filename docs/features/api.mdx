# API

TSCord is not only a Discord Bot, it has also an API in its core!<br />
This API lets you interact with the bot instance and the DB from external services using REST requests.

:::info
It uses the `routing-controllers` package under the hood, check the **[official documentation here](https://github.com/typestack/routing-controllers#table-of-contents)** to learn how to customize it and add new endpoints.
:::

## Initialization

First, you need to put a unique **API_ADMIN_TOKEN** in the `.env` file (you can generate it [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version1 )).
You can also customize the port it is running on.

```env title=.env
API_PORT=4000
API_ADMIN_TOKEN="PUT_A_RANDOM_TOKEN_HERE"
```

Then, you'll have to enable the API server in the config as it is disabled by default:
```ts title=src/config/general.ts
export const generalConfig: GeneralConfigType = {

    //highlight-next-line
    enabled: true,
    port: process.env['API_PORT'] ? parseInt(process.env['API_PORT']) : 4000,
}
```

## Swagger

The API includes an OpenAPI Swagger webpage, accessible at this endpoint:
```
/docs
```

It is an interactive documentation of all the endpoints and their parameters.

## Authorization

Most of the API is protected by an authorization system.
It is designed following a classic [Bearer-like header authorization](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) pattern.

It accepts two type of tokens:
- **Discord OAuth2 token**: the authorization system will fetch the actual discord user from the provided token, and then checks if its ID is included in the `devs` config property.
- **Admin Token**: if the provided token correspond to the one in the `.env`, it will authorize the request.

## Architecture

All the API code lives in `src/api/`.
It is splitted as follow:

```
src/api/
├── controllers # all the controllers (= endpoints), grouped by module file
├── middlewares # the middlewares are functions that are executed before the controller
└── server.ts # the server itself
```
