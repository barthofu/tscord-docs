# Scheduler

The scheduler lets you schedule functions to be run each X time or at each X time.
It uses [cron jobs](https://ostechnix.com/a-beginners-guide-to-cron-jobs/) under the hood, so you should be familiar with its syntax.

To setup a scheduled function, just add the `@Schedule()` decorator on top of it (only works with methods within a class!).

*E.g:*

```ts
import { Schedule } from '@decorators'

export class YourService {

    @Schedule('*/5 * * * *') // will run this function every 5 minutes
    foo() {
        console.log('foo')
    }

    @Schedule('0 0 * * *') // will run this function every dat at 00:00
    bar() {
        console.log('bar')
    }
    
}
```
