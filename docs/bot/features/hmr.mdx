# HMR

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature to inject updated modules into the active runtime. This allows you to see changes in your application without a full reload.

HMR is currenlty only working with **events** and **commands** files due to some limitations. We are planning to add as much support as possible in the future.

:::caution
It is important to not confuse HMR, which is an advanced technique that allows you to keep the state of your application while updating the code and feels almost instant, with the simple "automatic restart on save" happening on other files than **events** and **commands** ones.
