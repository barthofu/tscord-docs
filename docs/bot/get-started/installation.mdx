# Installation

:::info
#### Requirements

- **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (*>= 18.x.x*)
- **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)**
- **[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)**
:::

1. Install the official CLI globally

    ```
    npm i -g tscord-cli
    ```

2. Run the init command

    ```
    tscord init bot <name_of_your_bot>
    ```

    It'll initialize a fresh TSCord-based discord bot, install its dependencies and setup git on it!

:::tip
Check the [CLI documentation](/docs/cli/usage) to know more on this and other commands!
:::

:::caution
If the `tscord init bot` command fails with an exit error code of 1, it is likely that the dependencies installation step has failed.

In most cases, it is due to the lack of native build tools on your system required by `node-gyp`. You can fix this by following the steps mentioned in the [official node-gyp documentation](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
