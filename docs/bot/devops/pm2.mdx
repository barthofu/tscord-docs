Useful commands:
- `pm2 ls` -> list all the currently running process along with their `id`, run this command the first time and copy the id corresponding to your bot for furthermore commands
- `pm2 stop <id>` -> stop the process
- `pm2 restart <id>` -> restart the process
- `pm2 log <id>` -> attach the log of the process to the current terminal window (you can `ctrl`+`c` at anytime, it won't stop your bot)
