# CLI

TSCord has a fully customizable built-in CLI using **[plop.js](https://github.com/plopjs/plop)**!<br />
It lets you simply generate different kind of files as needed, with a powerful templating engine.

To use it, run:
```
npm run plop
``` 

Then you'll have to choose the type of the file you want to generate.

Current supported types are:
- `Command`
- `Event`
- `Entity`
- `Guard`

We **highly** recommend to use the CLI whenever you need to create these, as it will save you many times!

## Customization

If you want to customize the behavior of the CLI, head over to these docs/resources:
- https://plopjs.com/documentation/
- https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js

The CLI source code is located in `cli/`.
