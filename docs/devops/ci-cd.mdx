# CI/CD

TSCord bundles itself with a complete setup for **[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)**!

Github Actions lets you automate your workflow for building, testing and deploying your application.

More concretely, the provided config will permit you to deploy your bot to a SSH accessible remote machine (like a VPS) on precise events, like the creation of a tag on Github, a push to the `main` branch, on demand, etc...

## Configuration

### Secrets

First, you need to setup some *secrets* in the settings of your github repo (**Settings** > **Secrets** > **Actions**).

From there, add the following secrets (don't worry, after you've set a secret nobody will be able to read it):

| Name           | Description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `IP`           | The IP of the machine that will host your bot |
| `PORT`         | Put `22` (SSH port)                           |
| `USER`         | Name of the host user to connect as           |
| `PASSWORD`     | Password of the host user to connect as       |
| `PROJECT_PATH` | The absolute path to your project on the host |

### Workflow config file

Then, you can customize the behavior in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` config file.

:::tip
To know how to use Github Actions config files, **[check the doc here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)**.
:::

By default, the deploy workflow is only triggerable on-demand (**Actions** > **Deploy (SSH)** > **Run workflow**).<br />
We recommand you to either add a trigger on release tag creation or on pushes on your `main` branch, depending on your global git workflow.

Also, by default, the deploy action will use **Docker**, but you can easily replace it with **PM2**:

```yml title=.github/workflows/deploy.yml
        script: |
            cd $PROJECT_PATH
            git pull https://github.com/barthofu/tscord-template.git main
            // remove-next-line
            docker-compose up -d --build
            // add-next-line
            pm2 restart pm2.config.json
```

:::info
Each line under the `script` property is a command that'll be run on your host machine. You can customize it as you want!
