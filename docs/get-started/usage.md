# Usage

Now that your bot is all setup, you can start using it!

Start by **building** the typescript code source in a javascript production ready bundle
```bash
npm run build # 
```
Then, you can **serve** that production build (= start the server)
```bash
npm run serve
```

<br/>

Or if you are currently developping the bot and want an instant startup alongside automatic refresh on files save, use
```bash
npm run dev
```
